The purpose of this repository is to accumulate security analysis artefacts with partial assistance from Large Language Models that help with the following:

* Conform the use of language to colloqial terminology
* Rapdily process large amounts of complex information robustly and flexiblt
* Dynamically orient the goal-setting for the duration of this project
* Articulate the vision of an advanced cybersecurity paradigm for detecting anamolies 
* Emphasize sophistication as the primary means of preserving accessibility without increasing risk
* Intend upon efficiency as the means for attaining that sophistication, rather than higher expense

The current goal for this project is to produce, at  minimum, 10 tightly-scoped security analyses while progressing through independent study.
