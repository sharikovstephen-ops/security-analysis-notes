This repository contains a collection of tightly scoped cybersecurity analysis artifacts.

The work emphasizes system-level reasoning about identity, resources, detection, and risk tradeoffs. 
Large Language Models are used selectively as an analytical aid (e.g., terminology alignment, hypothesis generation, and summarization).
All conclusions, judgments, and prioritization decisions remain human-driven.

The goals of this repository are to:

  * Express security analysis using terminology consistent with professional practice
  * Analyze complex systems efficiently without unnecessary restriction or cost
  * Explore detection-oriented security architectures that preserve accessibility
  * Produce clear, auditable reasoning rather than tool- or framework-centric output

The initial objective is to produce at least ten independent security analyses, each focused on a concrete system, workflow, or failure mode.
